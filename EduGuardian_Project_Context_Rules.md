**Vision:** EduGuardian is an education-tech platform built with React, Node.js/Express, MongoDB, and Cloudinary. Its mission is to help students by providing personalized learning resources, AI-driven tutoring features, and progress analytics. The codebase follows a full-stack JavaScript stack: the frontend is a SPA in React (using custom components and hooks), and the backend is a RESTful API with Express and MongoDB as the database. Cloudinary is used for media (profile photos, etc.). 

**Stack & Structure:** The project is organized by feature modules. Key frontend modules include Auth, Dashboard, Courses, Profiles, etc., each containing React components, styles, and tests. The backend is structured with separate directories: controllers/ (handling HTTP requests), services/ (business logic), models/ (Mongoose schemas), routes/, middleware/, and utils/. Environment-specific settings (DB URI, API keys) are stored in .env files (not committed). The app uses JWT for authentication, with protected routes requiring valid tokens. 

**Main Features:**
User Authentication: Sign-up/login with JWT tokens. Passwords hashed.
Course Management: Create and manage courses. Students can enroll in courses.
AI Tutoring (Future): The system will incorporate AI to offer quiz generation and personalized study tips (see AI Features doc).
Media Upload: Users can upload avatars or course images; files are stored via Cloudinary.
Analytics Dashboard: Students and teachers see progress charts and reports.

**Roadmap:** Future work includes migrating to TypeScript, improving the component library, and adding new AI-driven features like chatbot assistance and content recommendations (detailed in EduGuardian_Todo_AI_Features.md). We also plan to optimize performance (e.g. caching hot resources) and strengthen security (rate limiting, penetration testing). This context helps all team members and new hires understand the projectâ€™s goals and architecture.
