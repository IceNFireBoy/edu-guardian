# SonarCloud Issues (Fixed Ninth Batch)

Additional fixes in the ninth batch:

## 1. Authentication Middleware Improvements

### auth.ts middleware
- Fixed unused parameter warnings:
  - Added underscore prefix to unused `res` parameters in `protect` middleware
  - Added underscore prefix to unused `res` parameters in `authorize` middleware
  - Ensured proper code documentation for middleware functions
- Enhanced error handling for JWT verification
- Improved type safety with better interfaces for decoded tokens

## 2. Test Suite Cleanup

### AuthService.test.ts
- Fixed unused variable warnings:
  - Removed unused `user` variable in `updateUserPassword` test
  - Created separate test user to avoid test interference
  - Improved assertion code for password update verification

## 3. Type Safety in User Factory

- Added proper type assertions for user-related test factories
- Ensured MongoDB object IDs are correctly cast to strings when needed
- Fixed issues with subjects array types in User model tests

## Progress Overview

In Batch 9, we focused on addressing TypeScript compiler warnings related to unused variables and parameters in middleware and tests. These improvements help reduce noise in the codebase, making it more maintainable and easier to understand.

The key improvements are:
1. More consistent parameter naming conventions with underscore prefixes for unused parameters
2. Streamlined test setup with clearer variable usage
3. Better type safety in authentication middleware

The overall progress across all batches now stands at approximately 95% completion. The remaining issues are primarily related to:
- Fixing a few complex test files (NoteService.test.ts, BadgeService.test.ts)
- Addressing remaining MongoDB test connection issues which are environment-specific
- Making sure all mocked functions have proper TypeScript definitions
