# PDF Viewer Error Fixes

## Problem Solved
Fixed the "Minified React error #31" that was occurring when deploying the application to Netlify, particularly with the PDF viewer component.

## Root Causes
1. Invalid props being passed to the PDF viewer component
2. Lack of proper error handling for PDF loading
3. Insufficient URL validation for PDF sources
4. Missing error boundaries and fallbacks

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced PDFViewer Component
- Added more robust prop validation with `Boolean()` for URL checking
- Implemented iframe error detection with event listeners
- Created a loading state with visual feedback
- Added safer URL construction with `getSafeUrl()`
- Refactored rendering into a dedicated `renderPDFContent()` method
- Wrapped in ErrorBoundary for crash prevention

### 2. Improved NoteViewer Component
- Enhanced URL extraction with better fallbacks
- Added URL validation and auto-fixing for malformed URLs
- Implemented comprehensive error handling with try/catch
- Added debugging logs to trace issues
- Updated dependency array in useEffect to properly handle URL changes

### 3. Strengthened ErrorBoundary
- Added specific handling for React error #31
- Enhanced error reporting with component stack analysis
- Added fallback prop support for custom error displays
- Improved navigation options with "Go Back" button
- Added error logging to the DOM error display

### 4. Development Improvements
- Fixed module type warning in build process
- Added CSS for better visual error states
- Created a loading indicator for PDF documents

## Testing
- Tested with various PDF URLs
- Verified handling of null and invalid URLs
- Confirmed build process completes without errors
- Created TestPDFDebug component for easier debugging

## Deployment Notes
When deploying to Netlify:
1. Ensure proper environment variables are set
2. The app will now gracefully handle missing or invalid PDF URLs
3. Users will see helpful error messages instead of blank screens or crashes
4. Error boundaries will prevent the entire app from crashing

## Additional Recommendations
1. Consider implementing a PDF.js based viewer for more control
2. Add server-side URL validation
3. Implement content type checking before attempting to render PDFs
