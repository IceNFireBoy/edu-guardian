## Future Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Add proper user authentication for protected routes (the backend is already set up for this).

2. **Pagination**: Implement pagination for large note collections.

3. **Analytics**: Add usage tracking for popular notes, download counts, etc.

4. **Search**: Implement full-text search across notes.

5. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests for critical functionality.

## Environment Setup Required

For the application to function properly, the following environment variables need to be set:

### Frontend (.env or Netlify environment variables)
```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your-upload-preset
```

### Backend (.env or Render environment variables)
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://...
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```
