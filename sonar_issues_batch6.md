# SonarCloud Issues (Fixed Sixth Batch)

Additional fixes in the sixth batch:

## 1. Cognitive Complexity Reduction and Code Refactoring

### UserService.ts
- Refactored AI quota and streak management methods:
  - Extracted common logic to `isQuotaResetDue` and `resetUserQuota` helper methods
  - Improved error handling with more consistent patterns
  - Simplified conditional logic in `updateUserAIStreak`
  - Added proper documentation with JSDoc comments
  - Made edge case handling more robust (e.g., first-time AI usage)

### NoteService.ts
- Refactored AI generation methods:
  - Created `validateNoteForAIProcessing` helper to eliminate duplicate validation code
  - Extracted `processAIFeatureBadges` method to manage badge processing
  - Added robust `parseAndValidateFlashcards` method with multiple fallback strategies
  - Enhanced error handling with specific OpenAI API error catching
  - Improved the `saveGeneratedFlashcardsToNote` method with better validation

### User.ts
- Enhanced the `updateStreak` method:
  - Improved null checking for streak initialization
  - Added explicit handling for same-day logins
  - Used Math.max for more concise max value calculation
  - Added error handling around the database save operation

## 2. Error Handling Improvements

### customErrors.ts
- Added proper JSDoc comments for all error classes
- Standardized parameter typing and default value handling
- Made sure all error constructors follow consistent patterns
- Used more specific error descriptions

## 3. Type Safety and Validation Enhancements

- Added more robust type checking across all refactored methods
- Enhanced validation for flashcard objects with specific error messages
- Improved OpenAI response parsing with fallbacks for different response formats
- Added proper error propagation for downstream error handling

## 4. Code Quality Improvements

- Reduced code duplication by extracting common functionality
- Added consistent error handling patterns
- Improved method organization and naming
- Enhanced documentation with detailed JSDoc comments
- Made code more testable by breaking down complex methods

These fixes have significantly reduced cognitive complexity, improved error handling, and enhanced the overall code quality and maintainability of the codebase.
