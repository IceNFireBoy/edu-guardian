# SonarCloud Issues (Fixed Initial Batch)
The following issues were fixed:

- Removed duplicate imports in backend/src/__tests__/factories/note.factory.ts
- Fixed unused imports in various files
- Replaced logical OR (||) with nullish coalescing (??) for better type safety
- Removed useless assignments in test files
- Fixed unnecessary type assertions in test files
- Improved error handling in NoteService.ts
- Fixed potential optional chaining issue in UserService.ts

These fixes improved code quality and addressed several MINOR and MAJOR issues reported by SonarQube.

# SonarCloud Issues (Fixed Second Batch)

The following issues were fixed in the first batch:
- Removed duplicate imports in backend/src/__tests__/factories/note.factory.ts
- Fixed unused imports in various files
- Replaced logical OR (||) with nullish coalescing (??) for better type safety
- Removed useless assignments in test files
- Fixed unnecessary type assertions in test files
- Improved error handling in NoteService.ts
- Fixed potential optional chaining issue in UserService.ts

Additional fixes in the second batch:
- Replaced more logical OR (||) operators with nullish coalescing (??) in:
  - UserService.ts (getUserUploadedNotes, getUserFavoriteNotes, updateUserAIStreak)
  - AuthService.ts (sendTokenResponse, forgotPassword)
  - NoteService.ts (saveGeneratedFlashcardsToNote)
  - extractTextFromFile.ts
  - UserActivityFeedController.ts
  - advancedResults.ts middleware
  - server.ts (removed `as any` casts for xss and hpp middleware)
  - index.ts (PORT and NODE_ENV handling)
- Fixed type assertion in AuthController.ts by using proper ValidationError type

These fixes improved code quality and addressed several MINOR and MAJOR issues reported by SonarQube.

# SonarCloud Issues (Fixed Third Batch)

Additional fixes in the third batch:
- Improved type safety by replacing 'any' types with more specific types:
  - Created a proper `CookieOptions` interface in AuthService
  - Replaced Error handling 'any' types with `Error | unknown` in AuthService
  - Created a `BadgeEventData` interface in BadgeService
  - Fixed parameter types in BadgeService and UserService methods
  - Improved type safety in NoteService.getNotesByFilters
- Removed unnecessary console.log statements
- Added proper JSDoc documentation to BadgeService.checkAndAwardBadges method
- Improved error handling patterns

These fixes further enhanced type safety and code documentation across the codebase.

# SonarCloud Issues (Fixed Fourth Batch)

Additional fixes in the fourth batch:
- Enhanced middleware security and type safety:
  - Improved AsyncHandler middleware with better return type declarations
  - Enhanced error handler middleware with proper error typing and ExtendedError interface
  - Added stronger typing to authentication middleware
  - Improved error handling by properly using return after calls to next()
- Fixed a potential security vulnerability in NoteController:
  - Added regex pattern escaping to prevent ReDoS attacks for topic search
- Corrected NoteService usage in NoteController:
  - Switched from static class methods to proper instance methods
  - Created a singleton instance of NoteService
- Improved error handling patterns and control flow
- Added proper type annotations for return types
- Improved authentication middleware with better role type checking

These improvements strengthen the security, type safety, and reliability of the application.
