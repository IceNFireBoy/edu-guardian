## 3. Current Action Items (June 2025 Audit)

### 3.1. Critical Issues (Must-Fix)
- **Backend:**
    - ✅ Fixed API/network errors (404/500/CORS) for `/api/flashcards`, `/api/summarize`
    - ✅ Resolved session/JWT errors on page reload
- **Frontend:**
    - ✅ Fixed "React state update on unmounted component" (login/logout/route change)
    - ✅ Fixed dashboard badge/profile loading bugs (missing or stale user data)
    - ✅ Prevented duplicate submissions (debounce/disable form while awaiting API)

### 3.2. Major Issues
- [ ] Analytics and badge grid: fix grid/layout issues, especially on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Loading/performance: ensure spinners/loading states always visible until AI/network completes
- [ ] Standardize API error messages for user clarity
- [ ] Remove all React list "key" warnings (map arrays: badges, flashcards, analytics cards)

### 3.3. Dark Mode Issues (Design/Accessibility)
- [ ] Audit and fix all low-contrast text and button colors
- [ ] Ensure modals, pop-ups, and toasts always follow dark theme (no light/white overlays)
- [ ] Recolor or update all SVG/PNG icons for dark mode compatibility
- [ ] Fix graph/chart backgrounds, input field/placeholder colors, and all theme "flashing" on route changes

### 3.4. Minor Issues & UX Polish
- [ ] Add field auto-focus to login/register and key dashboard fields
- [ ] Ensure toast stacking/auto-close works as expected
- [ ] Polish spinner/loading state for rapid user actions
- [ ] Fix responsive/card overflow issues on mobile
- [ ] Refine badge pop-up animations and modal backgrounds

---

## 4. Future Features & Roadmap

- **Admin dashboard:** user, note, badge management
- **AI usage leaderboard:** real-time or periodic leaderboard logic
- **Advanced analytics:** heatmaps, streak trackers, XP/badge history visualizations
- **Export options:** PDF/CSV download of summaries, flashcards, or analytics
- **Live study/collab:** group/room codes, shared notes
- **Premium tier:** higher AI quotas, analytics exports, etc.
- **Mobile app:** React Native/Expo, push notifications

---

## 5. Next Steps (Actionable Checklist)

- [x] Fix all critical API/network and frontend "state update" bugs (see error list)
- [ ] Complete dark mode audit & patch: colors, icons, overlays, graphs, and modals
- [ ] Triage and refactor UI/UX: grid, badge, toast, spinner, responsive cards
- [ ] Add/expand tests for every newly fixed bug or component
- [ ] Update README and `/docs/` with resolved issues, open bugs, and next sprint goals
- [ ] Prepare next demo for user/stakeholder feedback
